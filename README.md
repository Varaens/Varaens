### Hello everyone!

My name is Florian, I'm 23 years old and I'm curently studying in Nantes at Digital Campus.
I'm currently learning stuff about Web Developpment, Web Marketing, and on top of it, Graphic Design.
I'm a huge pc components and videogames enthusiast. I mostly enjoy metal, rock, lo-fi, but also rap music from times to times.
I'm a beginner in programming, though this is a topic that I'm realy interested in. I'd like to learn more about C++, PHP, JS and CSS in
a near future. For the Alliance! ðŸŽ®

I am curently looking for an internship starting from the month of April, so please feel free to check my resume!
