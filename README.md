### Hello everyone !

My name is Florian, I'm 23 years old and I'm curently studying in Nantes at Digital Campus.
I'm a huge pc components and videogames enthusiast. I mostly enjoy metal, rock, lo-fi, but also rap music from times to times.
I'm a beginner in programming, though this is a topic that I'm realy interested in. I'd like to learn more about C++, PHP, JS and CSS in
a near future. For the Alliance ! ðŸŽ®
